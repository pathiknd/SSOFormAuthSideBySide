# Single Sign-on (SSO) and FormsAuthentication side-by-side

Lot of existing ASP.Net Applications use forms authentication and they have to now integrate with various external Identity Providers (IdP). This demo is Proof of Concept to have both legacy Forms Auth and Single Sign-On side-by-side in same application.

Demo uses Kentor library - https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2. It is an open source library that does the legwork to integrate SAML2 based Indentity Providers with ASP.Net

Kentor support ASP.Net Web Forms, MVC and Owin based architectures. This demo uses MVC but the same approach can be used in other applications as well.
